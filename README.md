- **Retarget Lapsed Viewers**: Since subscriber growth declined post-2019, consider re-engagement campaigns or content refreshes to win back your audience.
- **Monitor Daily Engagement Patterns**: Analyze peak days with high likes for potential scheduling strategies or content pacing.
- **Optimize RPM Strategy**: Given the strong revenue per 1,000 views ($40.87), consider monetization tactics such as mid-roll ad placement or sponsorship integration.
